              </h5>
              <p>My name is Tsangyu Lin, I was born in Taichung City,
                Taiwan in 2000<br>
              </p>
              <p>Currently I am major in software engineering in Tamkang University,
                 planning in 2021 Winter Semester to be an exchange student in LMU Munich with same faculty.
                 I can speak 4 languages, which are English, German, and Mandarin Chinese.
              </p>
              <p>I was born in a average-wealth family, with my sister and my father in Taipei. 
                During the workday, I am in the student dormitory in Tamkang university Lanyang campus, which is located in Yilan.
                I am enthusiastic with programming since I was 9 year old, it all started when my mother's collegue gave me a book called "Fundamentals of Visual Basic 6.0".
                Since that day I had been trying every examples in the book, and after few days, instead of just copying from the book directly, I can gradually modify the code to the way 
                I wanted to. Then the very first program I had ever been created, it's called "An easy game of basic math."
              </p>
              <p>
                After several years, I started to experience different fields in programming language, 
                including C++, C, Java (which is my best programming language so far), Python, and so forth.
              </p>
              <p>
                But sometimes I would be lazy too, in the years of elementary school, I was obsessed by a game called “Minecraft”, which is a sandbox building and survival game. And I love to play it so much, even abandoned my whole school work. Everytime I come back home, the first thing I want to do is just play Minecraft. And after I got bored of the single player, I opened a server to invite more friends to play with me. And it is the start of a catastrophe. Because the day I opened the server, I noticed that even if I created the server, most people wouldn’t know it very much. So I and my other 2 friends started advertising in the whole elementary school. Then pissed the teachers off, scumming us dramatically. Then we even have fights about the server, that someone destroys to another’s house. And one of my friends even swears to my cousin through the answering machine. So I got scolded by my uncle too. Then after this tragedy, I just came back to programming until now.
              </p>
              <p>The greatest achievement in my whole life is that I have lost over 30 kilograms.  Why am I losing weight?  Because I said last year that if I don't lose it, my heart problem will worsen since I was born.  And after losing weight, not only have I used to be healthier now, but I've also had a sports habit.  Of course I do a lot of sports and I use an application called MyFitnessPal to log my meals. Though I become 5 more kilograms than the day I stopped logging, I still go cycling and logging them on Strava. Now I start logging them again. Hope it will have some great results.
</p>
              <p>Also, my favorite sport is cycling and running on a treadmill.  Because both sports the distance can be logged.  This way I can get a lot of GIS activities, and get achievements from them.  I have visited many places with my giant bike, for example, from Songshan Railway Station to Taoyuan Airport, or from Chung Yuan University to Taipei Railway Station. And the longest journey is from my home in Taipei to my university, Tamkang University Lanyang Campus.  During the excursion you can see many colorful views near the Pacific Ocean.
              </p>
              <p>I have been programming in the computer science side since I was seven years old.  My favorite program language is Java program language.  But I've learned other languages, for example, Python, C language, C ++, and so on.  Although most courses are not about programming, I'm still learning.  And then, I like books on science fiction, for example, artificial intelligence or IoT, spacecraft and so on.  That's why I study a lot of books about A.I.  while i was in high school.  But of course the mathematics of the A.I.  honestly difficult.  There is a sigmoidal function, RELU, a neural network that needs advanced calculus.  So it's still a long way to learn, but while I'm studying in the Innovation Informatics Technology department, there are many nice teachers to help me.

              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, I am now able to cooperate with my father making an artificial intelligence project with Region Convolutional Neural Network, which is an algorithm that can detect the object by training an AI model. The project is doing well, then now it has the ability to segment cells from the fusion forming stage. Then the accuracy of it is kept enhancing. By the information of my father, that it would be presented to the EMBL, which is a big biology studying center of the entire Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another Project I did, it’s a chrome extension I developed, when I was in first semester in university. This project was cooperated with the student, who was taught by my mother. And she is now studying news. So she asked me to make this extension, to analyze which news website is more reliable. Initially we want to use artificial intelligence making supervised training. But depending on the lack of datas, we choose to make a button on each post, which can view more similar news but different sources. Now she is finding more testers to see the reliability of this extension.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the page about language to study in Germany, I am learning German really hard.  During the learning experience I have many nice teachers and classmates to face, they really help me a lot.  To be honest, my first foreign language is not German but Spanish.  Because I thought that Spanish was the biggest language.  But after 2 years, I was just a twelfth student.  I heard that if I could study in Germany I would save a lot of money!  I have been studying German since that day. And now I even signed up to the language school in Heidelberg to prepare for the TestDaf C1 certification. I hope my German skills improve faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the year 2020, I lost my mother and my grandma, which is the most painful period in my life so far, since 2017 both my mom and grandma's
                 breast cancer tumors deteriorated badly, and almost every week, I need to spend over 3 days to take care of them. During these years, I finally know the importance 
                 to the family, not only the care of them, but also making my time efficiency to the most, as an old latin saying "carpe diem", I really miss the days, when my mother was alive.
                But my mother gave me almost the most resources she can give before she passed away. She taught me an important lesson, which is making my life more influential and sublime, not just long and dull.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Last but not least, I hope in the future, that I could get my dream job, which is being an IoT and Machine Learning programmer. Then learning more language makes me fulfilled and content. Then become a better person.
